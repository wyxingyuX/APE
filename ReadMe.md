# APE - Anomaly detection via Probabilistic pairwise interaction and Entity embedding

##Introduction

This is a keras re-implementation of APE model described in the paper "[Entity Embedding-based Anomaly Detection for Heterogeneous Categorical Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07502)".

To run it, first install keras + tensorflow/theano. Then, cd into sampler folder, and run ./make.sh to compile sampler code.

You may refer to demo.ipynb for the usage, and demo_toy/ for a peak of data format.
